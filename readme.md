This is a project for NyF by FruteroClub

MarioNormal is the Web2 version of Super Mario Bros, just run it locally

MarioWeb3 needs Next.js to play and then:

```git clone https://github.com/Ariiellus/MarioBrosWeekend.git
cd MarioWeb3
yarn chain
yarn start
```

I'm using ScaffoldETH2 to ship the Web3 version

### Ideas
- hETH to play a game
- Prediction markets for the next players
- Secret hETH multipliers (like secret lifes) accross the map
